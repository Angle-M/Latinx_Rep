                <p>Fox news is an American multinational conservative cable news television channel based in New York City. 
                    All too often from the news outlet they twist and misconstrued the actions and play into a model minority style of reporting. 
                    This can be seen with how they report statistics and how they interrupt them.</p>

                <p>Before I can continue on, I should explain what “model minority” is. Model Minority is the idea that 
                    “The term model minority refers to a minority group or a member of such a group stereotypically viewed 
                    as being more successful than other such groups or individuals. [2]” This term is often used for asian Americans 
                    but can apply to any minority. Fox News leans into the concept especially when talking about latinx/e people and so 
                    forth. They play into this with both polls and statistics while they may be from a neutral source it doesn’t tell the 
                    whole story.</p>

                <p>There are approximately 62.1 million Latinx/e people in the United States[3], 
                    and of those 62.1 million only 11.2 million can or do vote[3]. Only a fraction of 
                    Latinx/e people vote and if we follow that logic, at most 11.2 million participate 
                    in polls done by pollers. So the static mentioned in the Fox News video above is a prime 
                    example of this. While statistics may be true that 50%[1] of latinx/e’s approve of the former 
                    president Trump it doesn’t tell the whole story of how they are in the minority overall because 
                    they are only speaking from the 11.2 million that vote and participate in polls.</p> 

               <p> Many Latinx/e people don’t participate in polls and voting due to many older people from the 
                   community not seeing the point in doing so if no one actually makes changes for the betterment
                    of the community. While a sad notion that many of the community resonate with, it could be a time 
                    to change that notion. This is all to say that Fox News and many other news outlets manipulate data 
                    and what it can mean to push a narrative. </p>
