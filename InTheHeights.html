                <h1>Nearly perfect representation, In The Heights</h1>
                <h2></h2>
                <p>
                    <h5>The Musical turned movie pushes the limit on storytelling for latinx stories. It makes nods to the stereotypes that were
                    once used as the only way to present lantix people and uses them in a way that allows for a new depth in storytelling.
                    Yet, why do I consider this a nearly perfect representation?</h5>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h5> The primary focus of the film is this idea of a seunito or a little dream, and it is apparent that it’s the driving
                    force of the movie, every character whether it is stated or not has a dream big or small and do whatever they can to
                    achieve it even if they struggle and hit roadblocks. The key example is Usnavi and his dream to go back to the Dominican
                    Republic and reopen his father’s bar, but as we see throughout the movie something always holds him back, along with the
                    bar being practically destroyed</h5>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h5>Usnavi, the kinda main character, even though the story revolves around 3 people, Usnavi is our narrator. The key scene
                    for him would be when he is talking about his parents coming from nothing and leaving behind their legacy to him but he
                    takes pride in this and he is also not afraid to move on to better things. This is something that many struggle with in
                    our community. Some of us don’t know how to honor our families history and some of us are afraid to move forward because
                    our families have given us so much, we become afraid to make our own choices out of fear we may not make them happy.</h5>
                </p>

                <div class="main__video">
                    <video width="400" controls >
                        <source src="Video/Usnavi.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    </video>
                </div>

                <p>
                    <h5> The movie goes beyond just the characters and their dreams, while they do focus on that all the while they are building
                    up the community, sprinkling details and fleshing out the world. We see how tightly knit the community is by seeing how
                    almost everyone knows Nina by name as she’s returning from college for break or how everyone in the community goes to
                    the candlelight vigil for the loss of Abuela Claudia.</h5>
                </p>
                
                <div class="main__video">
                    <video width="400" controls >
                        <source src="Video/Abuela.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    </video>
                </div>
                <p>
                    <h5> Something I want to highlight here is the clip below shows Abuela Claudia reflecting on her life and showing the
                    struggles of moving to america as an immigrant and how you make so many sacrifices to eventually have a better life for
                    your family. As she is deciding to stay or go she takes a moment to see the people she has in her life and peacefully
                    passes because her dream has come true, surviving and helping her community. This scene in my opinion shows prefect
                    representation of how the older generation of latinx people had to struggle and survive to get a better life, they had
                    to do work no one else would do and with stand the constant remarks towards them.</h5>
                </p>

        
                <div class="main__video">
                    <video width="400" controls>
                        <source src="Video/Nina.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    </video>
                </div>

                <p>
                    <h5>On the opposite end of the spectrum we see Nina, the kid who left the barrio. The one who is now carrying all the hopes
                    and dreams of everyone there. Her character embodies the responsibility that immigrant children, especially those who
                    are first generation college students face. We have the pressure from all the sacrifices and hardships our parents had
                    to go through to give us the opportunity we have now of attending college or being where we are and while many of us are
                    grateful for this and everything they have done, it puts so much pressure on us to make their sacrifice worth it.</h5>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h5> While these are just two of the stories told throughout the movie, these are the two that stuck out to me the most. They
                    tell a story both past and present, not shying away from what it took to get here and the steps moving forward. We honor
                    and understand where we come from as Usnavi does but not being afraid to move forward and making changes. This is a rich
                    and deep way to tell stories especially for the Latinx community</h5>
